Originally created for AP CSA Course's Project assignment in 2024. The original prompt for the project was:

13. Grading System in Java: 
This project built using Java is an important one to grade students based on 
their markings. It is the best project to start for beginners and has a GUI 
(Graphical User Interface) design.      
Abstract: The main aim to build this project is to help schools and 
universities to manage the details of the students (like name, class, total 
subjects, marks achieved, etc) and rank them on the basis of marks. It 
manages the calculation of the average marks achieved and ranks the 
student on the basis of marks. It stores the data of students in a MySQL 
database. The project is built on Java and has a fully GUI (Graphical User 
Interface). It has all the features like managing the records of students, 
integrating all records of examinations, displaying all the information, and 
keeping a track of it. 
Technologies Required: Java, Java Swing, MySQL Database, 
and JPanel

(This can be seen in description.txt)

The version I created used Java Swing to make a graphical user interface for this Grading System.
All DataBases are stored in .txt files and will be read by Java's Input Streams every time.

The Directories:
/codes -> All .java files
/files -> All .txt files

I know not how to create directories in GitHub, so I just list the design I had here instead.
